    <p>Stephen Colbert, the comedian and host of Comedy Central&#39s <q>Colbert Report,</q> will succeed David Letterman as host of <q>Late Show,</q> CBS&#39s flagship late-night franchise, when Mr. Letterman retires next year, the network announced Thursday.</p>

    <p>Mr. Colbert will sign on for a five-year term as the new <q>Late Show</q> host, according to the announcement from Leslie Moonves, the president and chief operating officer of CBS, and Nina Tassler, the chairwoman of CBS&#39s entertainment division.</p>

    <p>CBS moved quickly to name a successor to Mr. Letterman, the late-night TV fixture who has hosted <q>Late Show</q> since 1993 and who revealed his plans to retire in a surprise announcement to his audience last week.</p>

    <p>Speculation about who might take over from Mr. Letterman, who was also the founding host of NBC’s <q>Late Night</q> franchise, quickly coalesced around Mr. Colbert, who has played a satirically self-obsessed, know-it-all host on <q>The Colbert Report</q> since its creation in 2005, and before that a similar character on Comedy Central’s <q>The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.</q></p>

    <p>Other contenders to replace Mr. Letterman were said to include Craig Ferguson, the host of CBS’s <q>Late Late Show,</q> which follows Mr. Letterman&#39s program; Chelsea Handler, the host of <q>Chelsea Lately</q> on the E! cable channel; and Neil Patrick Harris, a star of the sitcom <q>How I Met Your Mother,</q> which concluded its run on CBS this year.</p>

    <p><q>Simply being a guest on David Letterman&#39s show has been a highlight of my career,</q> Mr. Colbert said in a statement. <q>I never dreamed that I would follow in his footsteps, though everyone in late night follows Dave&#39s lead.</q></p>

    <p>Mr. Moonves said in a statement: <q>Stephen Colbert is one of the most inventive and respected forces on television. David Letterman&#39s legacy and accomplishments are an incredible source of pride for all of us here, and today&#39s announcement speaks to our commitment of upholding what he established for CBS in late night.</q></p>

    <p>Mr. Colbert said he will not stay in character when he takes over <q>Late Show.</q> The network said specific creative elements, like a producer and a location, would be announced later. Both New York and Los Angeles have been lobbying to become the home of a new <q>Late Show.</q></p>

    <p>Comedy Central said in its own statement that it was <q>proud that the incredibly talented Stephen Colbert has been part of our family for nearly two decades.</q> The channel added, <q>We look forward to the next eight months of the groundbreaking &#39Colbert Report&#39 and wish Stephen the very best.</q></p>
