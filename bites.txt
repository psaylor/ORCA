try streaming conversion with sox again
try streaming converted audio out of sox again
find out what goes into making a Node.js module, maybe i can make my own for interfacing with sox since the one out there is a piece of shit
make the client and server work over https and wss (secure websockets)
make the client work on Firefox
add audio fading in/out so words like 'the' don't sound so truncated
user specification for ad-hoc utterance content
new bites
user highlight selection for range playback
within one audio recording
spanning audio recordings (use sox to join two or more audio files together)
play correct pronunciation alternating with their pronunciation multiple times
create dynamic recorder icon  that fills up as the audio volume gets louder; continuously listen to audio (getUserMedia) and find maximum volume over a small window of time (probably over the whole buffer length for now) and send processed output to some callback function
hold down spacebar to record? some fragments are really long and that might get annoying
allow for re-recording of sentences, possibly by hovering over the sentence and getting a little tooltip popup with a few options like "playback" or "re-record" or "play native speech"
